# Project: Cat Breed Application Server

## Warre Welvaert

## What is this?
This Laravel project is the server side of my project. This application provides the user with some API endpoints for different cat breeds.

This application is multilingual and supports both English and Dutch. This is done by using two database tables. One to hold the id and information that is the same for both languages. The other table holds the id of the breed and detailed information in one language per entry.

Anyone can ask the server to return all or one cat breed in English, Dutch or both languages at the same time. It's also possible to add, update or delete a cat breed by using their corresponding endpoints. 

The user however will have to register and login to do this. If the user successfully logs in they will receive a token. This will need to be provided when using the add, update or delete API calls. A detailed description of the available endpoints and the required bodies can be found below. When a POST or PUT is used, the server validates the body and will fail to modify the entry  if the validation fails.

The application uses JWT Authentication as seen in the tutorial on GitLab.

Most of the information in the cat breed database was generated by ChatGPT and may not be 100% correct. The pictures used belong to https://www.catbreedslist.com/.

## <br/><br/>Configuration
1. Generate a private key for the JWT Authentication this can be done by executing the command:
    >  php artisan jwt:secret

    This should add new line to the .env that looks like:
    > JWT_SECRET=key-goes-here

2. Run the migrations and seeders using the commands:
    > php artisan migrate

    > php artisan  db:seed

    This will create the database structure and populate it with provided data.

## <br/><br/>Available Endpoints
* Get in English:
  > GET - /api/en/cats
  > 
  > GET - /api/en/cats/(id)

* Get in Dutch:
  > GET - /api/nl/cats
  > 
  > GET - /api/nl/cats/(id)


* Get in both languages:
  > GET - /api/cats
  > 
  > GET - /api/cats/(id)

*  Login / Register:
   > POST /api/register
   > 
   > POST /api/login

    The body for the Register should look like:
   ```json
   {   
       "name": "string",
       "email": "string",
       "password": "string"
   }
   ```
   And Login:
   ```json
   {   
       "email": "string",
       "password": "string"
   }
   ```

* Add, update or delete in both languages (requires authentication)
  > POST - /api/cats
  >
